\description{
Augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and
diversity of a time series dataset by creating new instances of the original
data through transformations or modifications. The goal is to improve the
performance of machine learning models trained on time series data by
reducing overfitting and improving generalization.reverse the order of the data along the time axis.
