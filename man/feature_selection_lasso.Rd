\item{attribute}{The target variable.}

An instance of the FeatureSelectionLasso class.

\description{
Feature selection using Lasso regression is a technique for selecting a subset of relevant features from a larger set of features in a dataset for use in model training. The FeatureSelectionLasso class in R provides a framework for performing feature selection using Lasso regression.
}
\details{
The FeatureSelectionLasso class has the following properties:
data: the data frame containing the features and target variable;
target: the name of the target variable in the data frame;
selected: a logical vector indicating which features have been selected;
lambda: the regularization parameter lambda used in Lasso regression;
coef: the coefficients of the Lasso regression model.
The FeatureSelectionLasso class has the following methods:
fit(): fits a Lasso regression model to the data and selects the most relevant features;
summary(): provides a summary of the selected features and the Lasso regression model.
