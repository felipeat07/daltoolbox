\description{
Forward stepwise selection is a technique for feature selection in which features are added to a model one at a time, based on their ability to improve the performance of the model. The ForwardStepwiseSelection class in R provides a framework for performing forward stepwise selection.
}
\details{
The ForwardStepwiseSelection class has the following properties:
data: the data frame containing the features and target variable;
target: the name of the target variable in the data frame;
selected: a logical vector indicating which features have been selected;
model: the model object containing the selected features;
performance: the performance metric of the selected model.
The ForwardStepwiseSelection class has the following methods:
fit(): fits a model using forward stepwise selection and selects the most relevant features;
summary(): provides a summary of the selected features and the model.
